heaps 

max heap, min heap

max heaps are binary tree such that parent > child, root is the greatest element
O(1) lookup for maximum element in tree i.e used for implemention of priority queue
O(logn) to insert element
O(logn) to delete element


min heap are binary tree such that child > parent and root is the smallest element
O(1) lookup for minimum element in tree
O(logn) to insert element
O(logn) to delete element
